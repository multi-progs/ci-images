# Job image for the virtual CI, run by GitHub Actions as a `container:`.
#
# Same interpreter and extension set as the self-hosted runner image so a
# pipeline behaves identically on both, minus everything that exists only for
# the actions runner itself (the runner tarball, its user, sudo) and for the
# other repositories that share that image (Flutter). The PostgreSQL server
# binaries stay, for suites that run against a real database.
#
# Actions starts a container job as the image's default user and needs root
# there to mount its workspace, so there is deliberately no USER directive.
# The scripts under /opt/ci drop to the unprivileged `ci` account (uid 2000)
# with setpriv before they touch anything that came from a pull request.

# scripts. gcc and libc6-dev are cgo's toolchain, which `go test -race`
# needs. No sudo: nothing in a job may regain root.
